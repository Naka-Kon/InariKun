# Inari-Kun

Inari-kun is a bot for the Naka-Kon Discord Server which adds capabilities to manage synchronization of user roles with Google.
Specifically, it is used to automatically grant and manage the issuance of the Naka-Kon staff role.

This feature will eventually be taken over by FoxDen, but this much simplified bot is being introduced while FoxDen is in development.
